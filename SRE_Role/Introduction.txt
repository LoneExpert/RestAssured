Why SRE is Important?
-In modern companies, almost every business depends on digital services (apps, websites, APIs).
  -If Google Search is down for 1 hour, millions of dollars lost.
  -If banking app lags, customers lose trust.
  -If e-commerce site crashes on sale day, huge revenue loss.

-That’s where SRE comes in:
SRE ensures these services are reliable, fast, and scalable, while still allowing developers to push new features.


What SREs Actually Do?
-Think of SREs as “guardians of reliability” who also write code to automate ops.
1. Keep Systems Reliable
  -Ensure services meet uptime goals (e.g., 99.9%).
  -Use SLIs, SLOs, Error Budgets to measure reliability.

2. Incident Management
  -When things break → SREs are the first responders.
  -Handle on-call alerts, fix outages, document postmortems.
  -Example: If website goes down at 2 a.m., SRE team jumps in, restores service, and prevents repeat issues.

3. Monitoring & Observability
  -Collect metrics, logs, and traces.
  -Build dashboards & alerts.
  -Example: Monitor API latency → alert if response time > 2 seconds.

4. Reduce Toil with Automation
  -Manual tasks (like restarting servers, scaling apps) → automate using scripts, Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.
  -Saves time, reduces human errors.

5. Balance Between Speed & Stability
  -Developers want to ship features fast.
  -Business wants reliability.
  -SREs enforce Error Budgets → If system is too unstable, stop new releases and focus on fixes.

6. Capacity Planning & Scaling
  -Predict future traffic and prepare systems.
  -Example: before Diwali sale, SREs ensure servers can handle 5x traffic.

7. Collaboration
  -Work closely with Devs, QA, Security, and Product teams.
  -Act as a bridge between Development (speed) and Operations (stability).


Why Companies Need SREs?
  -Downtime = Money loss (Amazon once lost ~$100M in 1 hour downtime).
  -Automation reduces costs (less manual work, fewer engineers needed for ops).
  -Reliability builds trust (users won’t tolerate constant outages).
  -Scalability (companies like Google, Netflix handle billions of requests daily thanks to SRE practices).


In short:
SRE = keeping systems up, fast, and reliable while making ops efficient through automation.
