###📌 What is RestAssured?
##✨ RestAssured is a Java-based library designed to simplify REST API automation testing.
Instead of testing APIs manually with tools like Postman, RestAssured allows you to write automated scripts that:

📡 Send HTTP requests → GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

✅ Validate responses → Status codes, headers, body content, response time

🔐 Handle authentication → Basic Auth, OAuth, JWT tokens

🔄 Run tests repeatedly → Perfect for CI/CD pipelines

🚀 Why RestAssured Matters in QA Automation

⚡ Fluent, human-readable syntax → easy to learn & implement

🔗 Integrates with TestNG / JUnit for structured test execution

📊 Supports JSON & XML response validation

🛠️ Compatible with Maven/Gradle build tools

🔄 CI/CD Ready → Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions & pipelines

📑 Enhanced Reporting → Combine with Allure / Extent reports for professional reports
