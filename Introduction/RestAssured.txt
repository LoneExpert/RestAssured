What is RestAssured?
-RestAssured is a Java-based library designed to simplify REST API automation testing.
-Instead of testing APIs manually with tools like Postman, RestAssured allows you to write automated scripts that:
  ->Send HTTP requests → GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
  ->Validate responses → Status codes, headers, body content, response time
  ->Handle authentication → Basic Auth, OAuth, JWT tokens
  ->Run tests repeatedly → Perfect for CI/CD pipelines

Why RestAssured Matters in QA Automation?
-Fluent, human-readable syntax → easy to learn & implement
-Integrates with TestNG / JUnit for structured test execution
-Supports JSON & XML response validation
-Compatible with Maven/Gradle build tools
-CI/CD Ready → Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions & pipelines
-Enhanced Reporting → Combine with Allure / Extent reports for professional reports

# With RestAssured, you can ensure your APIs are reliable, efficient, and production-ready with automated testing.
